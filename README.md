# Welcome to Remix!

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

Start the Remix development asset server and the Express server by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, which will purge the server require cache when Remix rebuilds assets so you don't need a process manager restarting the express server.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying express applications you should be right at home just make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

<!-- docker-compose build -->
<!-- docker-compose up -d -->

An idea about how to handle the tamplating,

- store details of the templates in the global database
- when user selects a template, the template's data is stored in session
- on each route file, the template data is retrieved from session and passed to the main componet
  eg:

```js
// route file, say index.tsx

export default function Index() {
  let { template } = useLoaderData();

  if (template.name === "template1") {
    return <Template1 />;
  } else if (template.name === "template2") {
    return <Template2 />;
  } else {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Index</h1>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(session, null, 2)}</pre>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(globalData, null, 2)}</pre>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
